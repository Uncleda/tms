# TMS(terminal management system)
base on `python2.7.5` & `Django1.9` & `fabric1.0`

This is just a demo!
If you want to test, please modify the `env.user` and `env.password` in fabfile.py
 
You can modify the shell scrip `runserver` based on your test environment 
and just run:
```
./runserver
```
It would start the server.
